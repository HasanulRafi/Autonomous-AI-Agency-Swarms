# üêù **Swarm Agency**

![Framework](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vrsen-ai/o/public%2Fgithub%2Fagency-swarm-logo-white.png?alt=media&token=76d8615d-1211-426a-bd4f-b9098cbfbc43)

## **Overview**
Swarm Agency is an evolved concept where autonomous AI agents collaborate seamlessly within a dynamic ecosystem. Initially inspired by Arsenii Shatokhin‚Äôs (aka VRSEN) AI Agency automation effort, we‚Äôve rebuilt the framework to allow you to effortlessly create your own swarm of specialized agents‚Äîeach with unique roles, skills, and tools. This approach makes automating tasks through AI more intuitive by defining roles like a virtual assistant, developer, and CEO, making collaboration fluid across agents.

Whether you're looking to optimize business operations, manage a team of virtual assistants, or create complex automated workflows, Swarm Agency lets you configure agents that communicate and collaborate to get tasks done efficiently. Get started with a fully deployable, customizable AI agency swarm!

## **Key Features**

- **Customizable Agent Roles**: Tailor agents to specific roles like CEO, virtual assistant, or developer with complete functionality customization using the [Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview).
- **Full Control Over Prompts**: Freedom to customize prompts without constraints, allowing full adaptability for complex tasks.
- **Tool Creation**: Build tools that integrate smoothly with your agents using [Instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor) for auto type-validation and easy interface setup.
- **Efficient Communication**: Built-in messaging system ensures seamless interaction between agents for optimal collaboration.
- **State Management**: Track and manage the state of your agents automatically with `settings.json`, ensuring smooth task execution and minimal downtime.
- **Production-Ready**: Designed to scale with your business needs and deploy in real-world environments.

## **Installation**

```bash
pip install -U agency-swarm
```

---

## **Getting Started**

1. **Set Your OpenAI Key**:

    ```python
    from agency_swarm import set_openai_key
    set_openai_key("YOUR_API_KEY")
    ```

2. **Create Custom Tools**:
Define custom tools with [Instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor):

    ```python
    from agency_swarm.tools import BaseTool
    from pydantic import Field

    class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
        # Define fields and logic for your custom tool here
        example_field: str = Field(..., description="Description of the example field")

        def run(self):
            # Implement your tool's logic
            do_something(self.example_field)
            return "Result of MyCustomTool operation"
    ```

3. **Define Agent Roles**:
Create specialized agents like CEO or developer, each with its set of instructions and tools.

    ```python
    from agency_swarm import Agent

    ceo = Agent(name="CEO", description="Task manager and decision maker.")
    ```

4. **Define Agency Communication**:
Set up how agents will communicate and collaborate across different roles.

    ```python
    from agency_swarm import Agency
    agency = Agency([ceo, developer, assistant], shared_instructions='agency_manifesto.md')
    ```
